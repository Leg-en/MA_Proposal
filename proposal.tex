    \section{Introduction}
    The siting of wind turbines is a multifaceted issue, fraught with complexity and political nuances. Onshore
    turbine placement is governed by a myriad of regulations, incorporating a range of parameters including, but not
    limited to: minimum distance to residential buildings, the foundation may only stand on a parcel of land and the
    turbines need a minimum distance between each other
    \cite{niedersachsischesministeriumfurumweltenergieundklimaschutzPlanungUndGenehmigung2021}.

    However, the public perception of wind turbines is often negative, with many people citing noise pollution, visual impairment and the potential for bird strikes as reasons for their opposition to wind power plants. This is despite the fact that wind power is a clean, renewable energy source that can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

    This leads to a situation where the siting of wind turbines is often met with resistance from local communities, who may be concerned about the impact of the turbines on their quality of life. This makes it a heavy politicized issue, with local governments often facing opposition from residents when trying to approve new wind power projects \cite{kwasniewskiWindenergieVerhindertAntiWindkraftBewegung2021}.

    Following that the specific research question to be answered by the thesis are:
    \begin{questions}
        \item How can a digital twin be used to simulate physical and environmental impacts of wind turbines on their surroundings?
        \item How can a digital twin influence public opinion on wind power plants?
    \end{questions}

    \section{Objectives}
    \subsection{General Objective}
    The objective of this research is to explore the potential of digital twins to impact public opinion regarding wind energy installations. The project involves the development of a digital twin for a wind power facility to accurately simulate and visualize its environmental effects. This initiative is designed to provide stakeholders with a detailed assessment of both the benefits and limitations associated with wind turbines, thereby aiding in the decision-making process for future developments.

    The digital twin is conceived as an interactive 3D application that allows users to traverse a specified test area, install turbines, and observe their influence on the local environment. The application is equipped to simulate aspects such as noise pollution and visual impairments, which include changes in the landscape and shadow effects caused by the turbines.

    Additionally, the digital twin will evaluate the risk of bird strikes and analyze the energy output and potential savings over determined periods. It will include a feature to ensure that turbine placements comply with existing legal frameworks and zoning regulations.

    Technologically, the digital twin will integrate various datasets to enhance its realism and functionality. It will support Esri i3s Meshes, incorporate weather data from DWD, and use land use classifications from local planning documents % (FNP? Bebauungsplan?)
    to ensure optimal turbine placement based on environmental and regulatory considerations. The application will also provide a comprehensive selection of turbine models, enabling stakeholders to choose configurations that best fit their requirements.

    An extensive user study will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the digital twin, focusing on the ease with which users can interact with and understand the application. Additionally, the study will assess the influence of the digital twin on users perceptions of wind energy, specifically looking at changes in attitude and support for wind energy initiatives resulting from their interaction with the twin.





    \subsection{SMART Objectives}

    \end{itemize}


    \section{Methodology}
    The methodology for this research project will involve a combination of data acquisition, software development, and user studies. The project will be divided into several phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the digital twin development and evaluation process.
    \subsection{Data Acquisition}

    Data acquisition is a pivotal component in the development of the digital twin, necessitating a systematic approach to collate multifarious datasets. This approach ensures an encompassing environmental and regulatory context, essential for accurate simulation and analysis. The following datasets will be acquired:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Terrain Data:} High-resolution terrain models are crucial for assessing site suitability and environmental impacts. We will utilize Esri Indexed 3D Scene Layers (i3s) Meshes, supplied by the Free State of Saxony, facilitated through a partnership with con terra.

        \item \textbf{Meteorological Data:} Specifically, wind data is integral for the site selection and optimization of wind turbine placements. This dataset will be sourced from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), which provides detailed wind statistics critical for wind energy applications in Germany \cite{deutscherwetterdienstWinddatenFurWindenergienutzer}.

        \item \textbf{Land Use Classifications and Zoning Information:} Essential for legal compliance and environmental planning, land use and zoning data will be sourced from the Saxony Open Data Portal \cite{freistaatsachsenOpenDataPortal}. This information facilitates the assessment of site suitability and regulatory alignment for wind turbine installation.

        \item \textbf{Wind Turbine Specifications:} Information regarding various wind turbine models will primarily be sourced from Enercon’s comprehensive product portfolio \cite{enerconglobalgmbhENERCONWindenergieanlagen}. To ensure a broader representation of available technologies, additional inquiries may be made to other turbine manufacturers, thereby expanding our dataset with diverse turbine types and specifications.
    \end{itemize}

    Integration of these datasets into the digital twin is anticipated to be straightforward, leveraging the capabilities of map.apps within an ArcGIS Enterprise Environment, supported by the data transformation and integration functionalities of Feature Manipulation Engine (FME).
