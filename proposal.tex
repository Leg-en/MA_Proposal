    \section{Introduction}
    The siting of wind turbines is a multifaceted issue, fraught with complexity and political nuances. Onshore
    turbine placement is governed by a myriad of regulations, e.g., in Lower Saxony incorporating a range of parameters including, but not
    limited to: minimum distance to residential buildings, the foundation may only stand on a parcel of land and the
    turbines need a minimum distance between each other
    \cite{niedersachsischesministeriumfurumweltenergieundklimaschutzPlanungUndGenehmigung2021}.

    However, the public perception of wind turbines is often negative, with many people citing noise pollution, visual impairment as reason for their opposition to wind power plants. This is despite the fact that wind power is a clean, renewable energy source that can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

    This leads to a situation where the siting of wind turbines is often met with resistance from local communities, who may be concerned about the impact of the turbines on their quality of life. Which makes it a heavy politicized issue, with local governments often facing opposition from residents when trying to approve new wind power projects \cite{kwasniewskiWindenergieVerhindertAntiWindkraftBewegung2021}.

    \section{Background and Literature Review}
    \subsection{Digital Twins}
    The concept of digital twins, first introduced in 2000, has gained significant popularity in recent years. Originally, a digital twin was defined as an exact mirror image of the real world, replicating all elements and processes. However, the definition has since broadened. Currently, a digital twin is understood as a simulation model that operates alongside real-time processes, applicable not only to physical systems but also to social and economic systems. Thus, a digital twin serves as an abstraction or model of the real world \cite{battyDigitalTwins2018}.

    Digital twins have been adopted across various disciplines, including manufacturing, the automotive industry, and the energy sector, addressing different challenges within each field. As accurate replicas of the real world, they are particularly effective for integrating solutions into complex analyses and providing decision support \cite{pylianidisIntroducingDigitalTwins2021}.

    \subsection{Technical Aspects}
    A fundamental aspect of this thesis is the utilization of 3D Meshes, specifically Esri/\gls{ogc} \gls{i3s} meshes. The \gls{i3s} format facilitates the streaming and distribution of 3D content across various (enterprise) systems. A single \gls{i3s} dataset, referred to as a scene layer, serves as a container for extensive and diverse 3D geographic data. To fully define a scene layer, both a layer type and a layer profile are required.
    The \gls{i3s} format supports various data types, including 3D objects, integrated meshes, point clouds, and building scene layers. It is designed with web, mobile, and cloud use cases in mind. Although it is developed by Esri, it is also part of the \gls{ogc} standards \cite{esriincI3sspec}.

    Given that map.apps is based on Esri's ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, integrating an \gls{i3s} layer into the application is straightforward. The ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript also provides additional analysis tools when an ArcGIS Enterprise environment is available. Particularly relevant to this project are the shadow analysis \cite{esriincShadowCast} and viewshed analysis tools \cite{esriincGeoprocessingViewshedAnalysis}.

    \subsection{Wind Energy}
    As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing issue, the importance of renewable energy sources continues to grow. The European Union aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, with renewable energy playing a crucial role in reaching this objective \cite{europeancommission.directorategeneralforclimateaction.GoingClimateneutral20502019}. Wind turbines present a viable solution, as they are a clean and renewable energy source with negligible greenhouse gas emissions \cite{pryorClimateChangeImpacts2020}.

    Germany, in particular, aims to significantly increase its share of renewable energy. A spatial strategy involves allocating 2\% of the land area for wind energy, with the objective of producing 115 GW of wind energy by the end of 2030 \cite{WindenergieLand}.

    In \gls{nrw}, the "Windenergieerlass" \cite{nrwErlassFurPlanung} regulates the allocation of wind turbines, aiming to balance the planning of wind turbines with considerations for residents and environmental protection \cite{nrwErlassFurPlanung}.

    Despite the challenges associated with the placement of wind turbines due to local community concerns, a recent survey revealed that onshore wind turbines are widely accepted across Germany, with over 81\% approval. Additionally, local community acceptance for existing wind turbines is high, with approval rates exceeding 80\%. The survey also indicates that the acceptance of existing wind turbines is higher than that of planned ones \cite{fachagenturwindenergieanlandUmfrageZurAkzeptanz}.

    \subsection{con terra Affiliations \gls{nrw}}
    %Ich bin mir nicht sicher ob das hier sein muss. Holger wollte das haben aber ich weiß nicht ganz was da rein muss... 
    In addition to various other projects within \gls{nrw}, con terra is currently engaged in a digital twin project aimed at enhancing hazard defense mechanisms in the \gls{nrw}. As part of this initiative, con terra has access to several high-quality datasets, including the comprehensive \gls{i3s} Mesh for \gls{nrw}.


    \section{Research Questions}
    % Reicht das als research question? 
    Following that the specific research question to be answered by the thesis are:
    \begin{questions}
        \item \label{rq:first_q} How well does the implemented digital twin interface enable non-expert users to accurately interpret and manipulate key wind energy parameters?
        \item \label{rq:second_q} To what extent can a digital twin of a wind power plant influence public support for wind energy projects?
    \end{questions}
    The primary objective of \ref{rq:first_q} is to assess the interaction between non-expert users and the digital twin. Following an experimental research approach, the evaluation will focus on the usability of the digital twin, with a specific emphasis on the ease with which users can interact with and comprehend the application. Consequently, the focus will be solely on the interaction with the digital twin.
    \ref{rq:second_q} aims to investigate the influence of the digital twin on public opinion concerning wind energy. Employing an experimental research methodology, influence in this context refers to any measurable changes in attitude and support for wind energy initiatives resulting from the interaction with the digital twin.
    Both research questions will be addressed through a user study, which will be conducted as an integral component of the thesis, adhering to the principles of experimental research design \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}.


    For \ref{rq:first_q} their will be no null or alternative hypothesis, as this follows a more explorative approach.
    For \ref{rq:second_q} it is the following:

    \begin{align}
        H_0 & : \text{Digital twins do not significantly influence public support for wind energy projects.} \\
        H_1 & : \text{Digital twins significantly influence public support for wind energy projects.}
    \end{align}


    \section{Objectives}
    \subsection{General Objective}
    The objective of this research is to explore the potential of digital twins to impact public opinion regarding wind energy installations. The project involves the development of a digital twin for a wind power facility to accurately simulate and visualize its environmental effects. This research is designed to provide stakeholders with a detailed assessment of both the benefits and limitations associated with wind turbines, thereby aiding in the decision-making process for future developments.

    A digital twin is conceived as an interactive 3D application that allows users to traverse a specified test area, install turbines, and observe their influence on the local environment. The application is equipped to simulate aspects such as noise pollution and visual impairments, which include changes in the landscape and shadow effects caused by the turbines.

    %Additionally, the digital twin will evaluate the risk of bird strikes and analyze the energy output and potential savings over determined periods. 
    % Wurde entfernt aufgrund holgers feedback, bin mir nicht sicher wie ich das  einbauen soll
    It will include a feature to ensure that turbine placements comply with existing legal frameworks and zoning regulations.

    Technologically, the digital twin will integrate various datasets to enhance its realism and functionality. It will support \gls{ogc}/Esri \gls{i3s} Meshes \cite{esriincI3sspec}, incorporate weather data from DWD, and use land use classifications from local planning documents % (FNP? Bebauungsplan?)
    to ensure optimal turbine placement based on environmental and regulatory considerations. The application will also provide a comprehensive selection of turbine models, enabling stakeholders to choose configurations that best fit their requirements.

    An extensive user study will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the digital twin, focusing on the ease with which users can interact with and understand the application. Additionally, the study will assess the influence of the digital twin on users perceptions of wind energy, specifically looking at changes in attitude and support for wind energy initiatives resulting from their interaction with the twin.





    \subsection{SMART Objectives}
    As the goals beforehand describe the general objective of the thesis, the SMART objectives will describe the specific goals of the thesis. The SMART objectives are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}[label={--}]

        \item Develop and integrate a module for evaluating inter-turbine interactions, such as wake steering, into the digital twin \cite{howlandWindFarmPower2019a}.
        \item  Design and implement a user-friendly interface for the digital twin, focusing on intuitive navigation and interaction to ensure that stakeholders can effectively utilize the application without prior technical expertise.
        \item Conduct a comprehensive user study to evaluate the usability of the digital twin prototype. This study will assess participants' ease of understanding and interacting with the application, aiming to confirm that the interface and functionalities are intuitively designed.
        \item Perform a user study to determine the influence of the digital twin on participants' opinions regarding wind energy. This evaluation will measure shifts in perception and support for wind energy projects as a direct outcome of using the application.
    \end{itemize}


    \section{Methodology}
    The methodology for this research project will involve a combination of data acquisition, software development, and user studies. The project will be divided into several phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the digital twin development and evaluation process.

    \subsection{Data Acquisition}
    Data acquisition is a pivotal component in the development of the digital twin, necessitating a systematic approach to collate multifarious datasets. This approach ensures an encompassing environmental and regulatory context, essential for accurate simulation and analysis. The designated test area for data collection is \gls{nrw}, Germany. Choosing which part of \gls{nrw} to focus on will be determined by the availability of data and the feasibility of acquiring the necessary information.
    The following datasets will be acquired:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Terrain Data:} High-resolution terrain models are crucial for assessing site suitability and environmental impacts. We will utilize Esri \gls{i3s} Meshes, supplied by the \gls{nrw}, facilitated through a partnership with con terra.

        \item \textbf{Meteorological Data:} Specifically, wind data is integral for the site selection and optimization of wind turbine placements. This dataset will be sourced from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), which provides detailed wind statistics critical for wind energy applications in Germany \cite{deutscherwetterdienstWinddatenFurWindenergienutzer}.

        \item \textbf{Land Use Classifications and Zoning Information:} Essential for legal compliance and environmental planning, land use and zoning data will be sourced from the \gls{nrw} Data Portal \cite{ministeriumfurheimatkommunalesbauunddigitalisierungdeslandesnordrhein-westfalenOpenNRW}. This information facilitates the assessment of site suitability and regulatory alignment for wind turbine installation.

        \item \textbf{Wind Turbine Specifications:} Information regarding various wind turbine models will primarily be sourced from Enercon’s comprehensive product portfolio \cite{enerconglobalgmbhENERCONWindenergieanlagenPortfolio}. To ensure a broader representation of available technologies, additional inquiries may be made to other turbine manufacturers, thereby expanding our dataset with diverse turbine types and specifications.
    \end{itemize}

    Integration of these datasets into the digital twin is anticipated to be straightforward, leveraging the capabilities of map.apps within an ArcGIS Enterprise Environment, supported by the data transformation and integration functionalities of \gls{fme}.




    \subsection{Development}
    The digital twin will be developed as a map.apps application, leveraging its capabilities for interactive 3D application development. The selection of map.apps, a proprietary product developed by con terra, was driven by several factors. Primarily, its foundation on the ArcGIS JavaScript API offers significant advantages. This  enables the visualization of any 3D environment within local Coordinate Reference Systems, specifically \gls{epsg}: 3857, which is mandated by German law. Currently, other open-source tools, such as CesiumJS, do not support this capability. Furthermore, map.apps supports one of the common standards for 3D meshes, Esri/\gls{ogc}'s \gls{i3s}. While 3D tiles present an alternative to \gls{i3s}, within the map.apps environment, they do not offer any additional benefits. The primary development efforts will focus on the creation of isolated bundles, each tailored to specific functionalities required for the digital twin. These functionalities include a noise simulation, a visual impairment simulation, an energy analysis tool, a legal assessment tool, an inter-turbine interaction module, and the user interface. The development will predominantly involve JavaScript/TypeScript, complemented by HTML and CSS for crafting the user interface. The principal frontend components will be designed as Vue components.

    The infrastructure necessary for this project, including the map.apps installation, ArcGIS Enterprise, \gls{fme}, and the required servers, will be provided by con terra.

    Should there be limitations in developing solely in JavaScript for the frontend, an additional Python component may be introduced to enable more advanced analysis capabilities.

    \subsection{User Study}
    As part of this thesis, a user study will be conducted to address the primary research questions \cref{rq:first_q} and \cref{rq:second_q}. The study will be divided into two distinct parts. The first part will concentrate on evaluating the usability of the digital twin, assessing user comprehension and experience across all aspects of the digital twin. The second part will investigate the impact of the digital twin on public opinion regarding wind power plants, examining whether users' opinions shift after interacting with the software.
    The study will not employ any specific selection criteria for participants. All participants will interact with an identical version of the digital twin system, without any randomization or variation in experimental conditions between subjects. There will be no designated control groups in this study design. As such, the sampling method employed in this study can be considered non-probabilistic sampling. To compensate for the limitations of this sampling method, demographic data will be collected from the participants to ensure that the sample is representative of the target population \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}.
    The study will involve a maximum of five participants, as it is suggested that five individuals can identify 80\% of the flaws \cite{virziRefiningTestPhase1992}. Moreover, research indicates that even 3.2 participants represent the optimal number for the best cost-benefit ratio \cite{nielsenMathematicalModelFinding1993}.
    The study will be conducted entirely remotely. Each participant will share their audio, screen, and camera, which will be recorded for subsequent analysis.
    %Bin mir sehr unsicher ob jetzt formative oder summative testing. Ich denke formative testing, da ich ja noch nicht wirklich weiß wie gut das ganze funktioniert

    The first phase of the study, addressing \cref{rq:first_q}, will involve conducting usability testing and formative evaluation utilizing the high-fidelity prototype. It will employ qualitative methods. This phase will adopt a Task Analysis approach, where participants will be assigned a series of tasks to complete using the digital twin. These tasks will be designed to test all facets of the digital twin. Throughout the task completion process, participants will be observed, and the observer will take detailed notes on user interactions and experiences. Measured here will be especially
    Post-task, participants will be requested to complete a questionnaire, providing feedback on their experience and rating the software. Additionally, this part of the study may be augmented by an expert-based testing with con terra`s UX experts. This will provide additional insights into the usability of the digital twin, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of the application's user-friendliness and effectiveness \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}.
    %Specifically tested will be for depending variables such as: efficiency, accuracy and learnability  \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}.

    The subsequent phase of the study, which addresses \cref{rq:second_q}, will employ an experimental research methodology \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}. It will be a qualitative user study, utilizing the same participant group. Participants will complete a questionnaire both before and after using the software. The questionnaire will assess their opinions on wind power plants, with the objective of measuring any shifts in perspective resulting from the software interaction. Additionally, at the end there will be an interview witch each participant. The comparative analysis of the pre- and post-use questionnaires and the interview will reveal any changes in opinion attributable to the digital twin.
    %Irgendwie will ich die wohl messen aber auch nicht so richtig.. Will ja wissen wie sehr sich die meinung geändert hat
    %Specifically tested will be for depending variables such as: cognitive demand, satisfaction and learnability  \cite{lazarResearchMethodsHuman2017}.

    Finally, the study outcomes will be thoroughly evaluated. As the study will be done as a qualitative study, the user input will pre preprocessed and the results interpreted. The findings will address the research questions, evaluating both the usability of the digital twin and its influence on public opinion regarding wind power plants. Additionally, recommendations for software improvement will be provided, though the implementation of these improvements will fall outside the scope of this thesis.
