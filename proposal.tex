    \section{Introduction}
    The siting of wind turbines is a multifaceted issue, fraught with complexity and political nuances. Onshore
    turbine placement is governed by a myriad of regulations, incorporating a range of parameters including, but not
    limited to: minimum distance to residential buildings, the foundation may only stand on a parcel of land and the
    turbines need a minimum distance between each other
    \cite{niedersachsischesministeriumfurumweltenergieundklimaschutzPlanungUndGenehmigung2021}.

    However, the public perception of wind turbines is often negative, with many people citing noise pollution, visual impairment as reason for their opposition to wind power plants. This is despite the fact that wind power is a clean, renewable energy source that can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

    This leads to a situation where the siting of wind turbines is often met with resistance from local communities, who may be concerned about the impact of the turbines on their quality of life. This makes it a heavy politicized issue, with local governments often facing opposition from residents when trying to approve new wind power projects \cite{kwasniewskiWindenergieVerhindertAntiWindkraftBewegung2021}.

    \section{Background and Literature Review}
    %Todo: Schön klingen lassen... 
    \subsection{Digital Twins}
    Digital twins are a relatively new concept that has gained popularity in recent years, it was first  mentioned in the year 2000. In the more narrow definition it is an exact mirror image of the real world, mirroring all elements and processes of the real world. But in more recent years a wider definition took that place. Today a digital twin is a simulation model that operate alongside real-time processes, applying to social and economic systems as well as physical systems. Therefore, a digital twin is an abstraction or a model of the real world \cite{battyDigitalTwins2018}.
    And as such digital twins are adopted by several disciplines, such as manufacturing, automotive and energy sector, solving different problems in each sector. As replicas of the world they optimally for integrating solution to complex analysis and decision support \cite{pylianidisIntroducingDigitalTwins2021}.
    \subsection{Technical Aspects}
    A fundamental aspect of this thesis is the use of 3D Meshes. Specifically Esri/OGC i3s meshes. The i3s format allow streaming and distribute 3D Content across various (enterprise) systems. A single i3s dataset, known as a scene layer, acts as a container for vast amounts of diverse 3D geographic data. To fully define a scene layer a layer type and a layer profile are needed.
    i3s also allows various kinds of data types. It can be 3D Objects, an Integrated Mesh, a Point Cloud or even a building scene layer. It is especially with Web, Mobile and Cloud usecases in mind designed. It is also created by esri but part of the OGC Standards. \cite{esriincI3sspec}.

    As map.apps is based on Esris ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript a given i3s layer can be trivial integrated into the app. 
    \subsection{Wind Energy}
    As climate change is a growing concern, the need for renewable energy sources is becoming more and more important. The EU aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. In order to reach that goal renewable energy source are one of the important factors \cite{europeancommission.directorategeneralforclimateaction.GoingClimateneutral20502019}. Wind Turbines may be one solution for this, as they are a clean and renewable energy source, with basically no greenhouse gas emissions \cite{pryorClimateChangeImpacts2020}.
    Therefore, Germany aims to increase the share of renewable energy sources. One spatial aspect is to allocate 2\% of the land area for wind energy, with the goal to produce by the end of 2030 115GW of wind energy \cite{WindenergieLand}.
    %In the free state of Saxony currently there a no central rules in place for wind turbine allocation, instead the authority is given to the local planning associations \cite{fachagenturwindenergieFachagenturWindenergieLand}. Todo: Wie ist das für NRW?
    In NRW there is currently the so called "Windenergieerlass" \cite{nrwErlassFurPlanung} in place, which regulates the allocation of wind turbines in NRW, with the goal to make the planning of Wind Turbines more orientated towards residents and environmental protection \cite{fachagenturwindenergieFachagenturWindenergieLand}

    \section{Research Questions}
    % Reicht das als research question? 
    Following that the specific research question to be answered by the thesis are:
    \begin{questions}
        \item \label{rq:first_q} How suitable is a digital twin for simulating various aspects of wind energy in a way that people can understand?
        \item \label{rq:second_q} How can a digital twin influence public opinion on wind power plants?
    \end{questions}

    \section{Objectives}
    \subsection{General Objective}
    The objective of this research is to explore the potential of digital twins to impact public opinion regarding wind energy installations. The project involves the development of a digital twin for a wind power facility to accurately simulate and visualize its environmental effects. This research is designed to provide stakeholders with a detailed assessment of both the benefits and limitations associated with wind turbines, thereby aiding in the decision-making process for future developments.

    A digital twin is conceived as an interactive 3D application that allows users to traverse a specified test area, install turbines, and observe their influence on the local environment. The application is equipped to simulate aspects such as noise pollution and visual impairments, which include changes in the landscape and shadow effects caused by the turbines.

    %Additionally, the digital twin will evaluate the risk of bird strikes and analyze the energy output and potential savings over determined periods. 
    % Wurde entfernt aufgrund holgers feedback, bin mir nicht sicher wie ich das  einbauen soll
    It will include a feature to ensure that turbine placements comply with existing legal frameworks and zoning regulations.

    Technologically, the digital twin will integrate various datasets to enhance its realism and functionality. It will support OGC/Esri i3s Meshes \cite{esriincI3sspec}, incorporate weather data from DWD, and use land use classifications from local planning documents % (FNP? Bebauungsplan?)
    to ensure optimal turbine placement based on environmental and regulatory considerations. The application will also provide a comprehensive selection of turbine models, enabling stakeholders to choose configurations that best fit their requirements.

    An extensive user study will be conducted to evaluate the usability of the digital twin, focusing on the ease with which users can interact with and understand the application. Additionally, the study will assess the influence of the digital twin on users perceptions of wind energy, specifically looking at changes in attitude and support for wind energy initiatives resulting from their interaction with the twin.

    \end{itemize}


    \section{Methodology}
    The methodology for this research project will involve a combination of data acquisition, software development, and user studies. The project will be divided into several phases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the digital twin development and evaluation process.

    \subsection{Data Acquisition}
    Data acquisition is a pivotal component in the development of the digital twin, necessitating a systematic approach to collate multifarious datasets. This approach ensures an encompassing environmental and regulatory context, essential for accurate simulation and analysis. The designated test area for data collection is a specific region within North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The primary rationale for selecting this area is the regional interest in digital twins and the opportunities they provide. Consequently, local support for the project is anticipated. The precise test area will be located in the vicinity of the city of [STADT NAME]. %Todo: Stadt Name einfügen
    The following datasets will be acquired:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Terrain Data:} High-resolution terrain models are crucial for assessing site suitability and environmental impacts. We will utilize Esri Indexed 3D Scene Layers (i3s) Meshes, supplied by the North Rhine-Westphalia, facilitated through a partnership with con terra.

        \item \textbf{Meteorological Data:} Specifically, wind data is integral for the site selection and optimization of wind turbine placements. This dataset will be sourced from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), which provides detailed wind statistics critical for wind energy applications in Germany \cite{deutscherwetterdienstWinddatenFurWindenergienutzer}.

        \item \textbf{Land Use Classifications and Zoning Information:} Essential for legal compliance and environmental planning, land use and zoning data will be sourced from the NRW Data Portal \cite{freistaatsachsenOpenDataPortal}. This information facilitates the assessment of site suitability and regulatory alignment for wind turbine installation.

        \item \textbf{Wind Turbine Specifications:} Information regarding various wind turbine models will primarily be sourced from Enercon’s comprehensive product portfolio \cite{enerconglobalgmbhENERCONWindenergieanlagenPortfolio}. To ensure a broader representation of available technologies, additional inquiries may be made to other turbine manufacturers, thereby expanding our dataset with diverse turbine types and specifications.
    \end{itemize}

    Integration of these datasets into the digital twin is anticipated to be straightforward, leveraging the capabilities of map.apps within an ArcGIS Enterprise Environment, supported by the data transformation and integration functionalities of Feature Manipulation Engine (FME).




    \subsection{Development}
    The digital twin will be developed as a map.apps application, leveraging the its capabilities for interactive 3D application development. The selection of map.apps, a proprietary product developed by con terra, was driven by several considerations. Primarily, its foundation on the ArcGIS JavaScript API offers significant advantages. This  enables the visualization of any 3D environment within local Coordinate Reference Systems, specifically EPSG: 3857, which is mandated by German law. Currently, other open-source tools, such as CesiumJS, do not support this capability. Furthermore, map.apps supports one of the common standards for 3D meshes, Esri/OGC's i3s. While 3D tiles present an alternative to i3s, within the map.apps environment, they do not offer any additional benefits.The primary development efforts will focus on the creation of isolated bundles, each tailored to specific functionalities required for the digital twin. These functionalities include a noise simulation, a visual impairment simulation, an energy analysis tool, a legal assessment tool, an inter-turbine interaction module, and the user interface. The development will predominantly involve JavaScript/TypeScript, complemented by HTML and CSS for crafting the user interface. The principal frontend components will be designed as Vue components.

    The infrastructure necessary for this project, including the map.apps installation, ArcGIS Enterprise, FME, and the required servers, will be provided by con terra.

    Should there be limitations in developing solely in JavaScript for the frontend, an additional Python component may be introduced to enable more advanced analysis capabilities.

    \subsection{User Study}
    As part of this thesis, a user study will be conducted to address the primary research questions \cref{rq:first_q} and \cref{rq:second_q}. The study will be divided into two distinct parts. The first part will concentrate on evaluating the usability of the digital twin, assessing user comprehension and experience across all aspects of the digital twin. The second part will investigate the impact of the digital twin on public opinion regarding wind power plants, examining whether users' opinions shift after interacting with the software.

    The initial segment of the study will employ qualitative methods, involving at least five participants. There will be no prerequisites for participation, particularly concerning their pre-existing opinions on wind power plants. This phase will adopt a Task Analysis approach, where participants will be assigned a series of tasks to complete using the digital twin. These tasks will be designed to test all facets of the digital twin. Throughout the task completion process, participants will be observed, and the observer will take detailed notes on user interactions and experiences. Post-task, participants will be requested to complete a questionnaire, providing feedback on their experience and rating the software.

    The second segment of the study will adopt a quantitative approach, utilizing the same participant group. Participants will complete a questionnaire both before and after using the software. This questionnaire will gauge their opinions on wind power plants, designed to measure any shifts in perspective resulting from the software interaction. The comparative analysis of the pre- and post-use questionnaires will reveal any changes in opinion attributable to the digital twin.

    Finally, the study outcomes will be thoroughly evaluated. For the first part, evaluation will be based on observational notes and questionnaire responses. For the second part, a comparative analysis of the pre- and post-use questionnaire results will be conducted. The findings will address the research questions, evaluating both the usability of the digital twin and its influence on public opinion regarding wind power plants. Additionally, recommendations for software improvement will be provided, though the implementation of these improvements will fall outside the scope of this thesis.
